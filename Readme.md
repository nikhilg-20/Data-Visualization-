## Introduction: 
The Seattle Dog License dataset provides information on licensed dogs in Seattle, including registration dates, breeds, and names. The Seattle Open Data Portal makes this data publicly available, providing insights into dog ownership patterns and trends. This analysis is crucial for pet-related businesses and city planners, aiding resource and service selection.


## Question:
•	What are the most popular dog breeds?
•	 What are the most popular dog names in Seattle?
•	How is the plagarism count changing?

## Hypothesis
According to the study, Chihuahuas will be the most popular dog breed, "Max" and "Bella" will be the most popular names, and Seattle's growing population and rising pet ownership rates will lead to a rise in dog registrations.

## Dataset Overview
•	The analysis used a dataset from the Seattle Open Data Portal, which contains over 50,000 records of licensed dogs. The dataset was cleaned to remove missing or irrelevant values, retaining 47,000 records.
•	Dog Name: The registered name of the dog.
•	Breed: The breed of the dog.
•	Date Registered: The date the dog was registered with the city.
•	Owner Zip Code: The ZIP code of the dog owner.


## Data Analysis and Visualizations
## •	Figure 1: Top 10 Most Popular Dog Breeds in Seattle
The Labrador Retriever is the most popular breed, followed in popularity by the Golden Retriever and Chihuahua. Poodles and French Bulldogs are among the smaller varieties that are also highly regarded. 

## •	Figure 2: Top 10 Most Popular Dog Names in Seattle
The most popular names are "Max" and "Bella," which corresponds with national dog naming trends. Additionally, the names "Charlie" and "Lucy" are frequently used.

## •	Figure 3: Number of Dogs Registered by Year in Seattle
Dog registrations have been steadily increasing, particularly after 2015. The rise is consistent with both Seattle's expanding population and rising rates of registration.

## Limitations
The analysis offers valuable insights but has limitations such as data completeness, time frame, and breed classification. Some dogs may not be registered with the city, and older records may provide historical trends. Additionally, self-reported breed data may lead to inconsistencies in mixed-breed dog classification.


## Conclusion
Using "Max" as the most common name and Labradors and Golden Retrievers as the most popular breeds, the Seattle Dog License dataset demonstrates the city's expanding pet ownership culture. Businesses, lawmakers, and municipal planners can all benefit from this knowledge. To provide more thorough insights, future studies may incorporate additional datasets such as survey or census data.
